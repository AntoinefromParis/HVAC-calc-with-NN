# HVAC-calc-with-NN
Deep Learning python code for HVAC cooling / Heating load calculation

Project Scope:
The project examines how a neural network can be applied within a design task of HVAC design, I decided to model a very common and fundamental process.

‘The initial calculation of cooling and heating loads for a medium size building’.

So the task became:

How to create a tool (trained AI model), which can predict the cooling and heating load of a medium size building by just providing some inputs without any engineering calculations.

Dataset used:
The dataset used was an existing collection from UCI Machine Learning repository [1] under the ownership and license of Athanasios Tsanas and Angeliki Xifara [2].
